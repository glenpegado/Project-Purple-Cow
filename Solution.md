# Future Updates

Add Stylying to the page with a counter and page views. Include cross browser support with mobile compatibility. Also make key endpoints more secure if theyd ever go into production. Lastly, intalling the API npm package would allows to add more features using their promise based tools.

## Changes

As the API gets updated, more functionality will be available.

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
