# Future Updates

For future updates I would have added styling to the page and also a counter and page views value. I'd also include cross browser support with mobile compatibility. Furthermore, I'd make the key endpoint more secure if it was ever going to be used into production. Lastly, installing the API npm package would allow us to add more features using their promise based tools.

## Changes

As the API gets updated, more functionality will be available.

# Intalling:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install packages:

### `npm install`

Will install all the NPM files into the application

3. Start application:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
